Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle having n2xn2 grids of nxn blocks that becomes increasingly difficult due to combinatorial explosion. As a result, a sequential implementation of a Sudoku puzzle solver can become both data- and compute-intensive.  In this project, we proposed a new parallel algorithm solver for the generalized NxN Sudoku grid that utilizes the manycore architecture. Our test results show that the algorithm scales well as the number of cores grows.
